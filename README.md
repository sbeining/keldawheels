# Lucky Wheels

This is a simple slot machine / lucky wheels that can be easily configured by
dropping files in folders.

## Configuration

* Create a directory called "slots" next to the executable.
* Create one directory for each wheel in the "slots" directory
  * The name only affects the order of the wheels (left to right)
  * You can create any number of wheels
* To populate the wheels, drop image files or ".txt" files into these folders
  for each item on the wheel.
  * The ".txt" file should only contain one item
  * The filenames only affect the order of the items on the wheel (top to bottom)
  * You can mix & match!
