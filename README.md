# Lucky Wheels

This is a simple slot machine / lucky wheels that can be easily configured by
dropping files in folders.

## Configuration

* Create a directory called "slots" next to the executable.
* Create one directory for each wheel (doesn't have to be three)
  * The name only affects the order of the wheels (left to right)
* Drop either an image file or a ".txt" file into these folder
  * The filenames only affect the order of the items on the wheel (top to bottom)
  * You can mix & match!
